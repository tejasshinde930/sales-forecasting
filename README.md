# Sales Forecasting Project

## About the Project
This project is about predicting future sales using past sales data.
Sales forecasting is important for businesses to plan inventory and
understand customer demand.

The project uses time-series analysis to study sales trends and make
future predictions.


## Objective
- Analyze historical sales data
- Identify sales trends and seasonality
- Predict future sales
- Compare actual sales with predicted sales


## Dataset
- **Dataset:** Sales Forecasting (Retail)
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting

The dataset contains daily sales data for different stores and items.
All sales are combined to get total daily sales.


## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- ARIMA
- Prophet


## How to Run
1. Install required libraries
2. Run the main file  


## Models Used
- **ARIMA:** Used as a basic time-series forecasting model.
- **Prophet:** Used to handle trend and seasonality more effectively.


## Result
Prophet performed better than ARIMA and produced smoother and more
accurate sales forecasts.


## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how time-series forecasting works
and how sales data can be used to predict future demand.
